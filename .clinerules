# Project Rules

## On Session Start
Read .ai-context/prompt_log.md → find any PENDING or IN-PROGRESS task → resume it.
Read .ai-context/progress.md → understand current project state.

## Every Task
1. Log to .ai-context/prompt_log.md as PENDING before starting
2. Update to COMPLETED with change summary when done
3. If interrupted → mark IN-PROGRESS with exact resume instruction

## Skills
Read .ai-context/skills/ files on-demand only — not every session:
- .ai-context/skills/coding-style.md → when writing code
- .ai-context/skills/git-commits.md → when committing

## Full Context
See CLAUDE.md for complete project details and key files.

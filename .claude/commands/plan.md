# /plan
# Plan a task BEFORE coding it. Fills SPEC.md, then you /clear and implement.
# Usage: /plan [describe what you want to build]

Do this:
1. Ask user what they want to build if not already stated
2. Think through the full implementation
3. Fill in SPEC.md with:
   - Files to create/modify
   - Functions/components needed
   - Edge cases
   - Order of implementation
   - Definition of done

4. When done, tell user:
```
📋 Plan saved to SPEC.md

Next steps:
  1. Review SPEC.md — edit anything that looks wrong
  2. Type /clear to start fresh coding session
  3. Say "Read SPEC.md and implement it"

This keeps planning context separate from coding context.
```

Do NOT write any code during /plan. Planning only.

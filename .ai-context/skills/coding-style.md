# Coding Style
> Read this file ONLY when writing or reviewing code — not every session.

---

## Language
[e.g. TypeScript strict mode / Python 3.11+ with type hints]

## Naming
[e.g. camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components, UPPER_SNAKE for constants]

## File Organization
[e.g. one component per file, colocate tests with source]

## Error Handling
[e.g. always use Result types / never swallow exceptions / always log with context]

## Comments
[e.g. comment WHY not WHAT / JSDoc for public functions only]

## Do NOT
- [e.g. use any type in TypeScript]
- [e.g. use console.log in production code]
- [e.g. write functions longer than 30 lines]

> Note: Code formatting (spacing, indentation, quotes) is handled by the linter — do not re-enforce here.
